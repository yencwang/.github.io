      <h1>Welcome to My Homepage</h1>
      <p>
        I am a Ph.D. candidate in the IDP Archaeology program at UCLA. My research spans two main areas: using scientific analyses to study organic remains, and analyzing artifacts, primarily Chinese ceramics, to understand consumption patterns across the maritime landscapes of East and Southeast Asia.

        With background in oceanography from Taiwan, I have investigated marine biodiversity changes through the study of fish otoliths. Under the guidance of marine biologists at Academia Sinica and National Taiwan University, my work challenges the notion that precolonial subsistence activities negatively impacted fish communities. Our findings indicate an IUCN endangered species has experienced life history changes primarily due to recent commercial fisheries rather than historical subsistence practices.

        Under the supervision of Southeast Asian archaeologists in UCLA, I also conduct research on Early Modern archaeological sites in the Philippines and Taiwan. For example, we discovered that a Spanish colonial-period church in Southeast Luzon was situated in a locality actively engaged in maritime trade even before Chinese participation—and that such exchange continued despite the collapse of larger agricultural societies. My dissertation examines Taiwan’s economy prior to the Industrial Revolution, focusing on the production methods of sugar introduced by Chinese immigrants and exploring how the consumption of Zisha by sugar craftsmen reflects Early Modern East Asian consumer culture.

        I am also currently collaborating with paleopathologists at UCLA on bioarchaeological studies in Taiwan. So far, we have identified a population involved in maritime trade that experienced varying levels of epidemic impact between the 5th and 11th centuries. We plan to continue working with this dataset and to involve undergraduates interested in human osteoarchaeology in our project.
